## TODO

- Uniform location for handling conversion of Remote (Coingecko) and Internal (Lightweight charts) types
- React Router does not have support for typing route params. I've made some effort to resolve this, but it's not perfect as it needs a lot of manual asserting. Consider alternatives like (react-router-typesafe-routes)[https://github.com/fenok/react-router-typesafe-routes], but also consider removing types altogether and perform runtime validation on route params instead.
